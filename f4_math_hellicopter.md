# Form 4 Math Helicopter
## Revision Ex3 Q49
### Problem
Given a graph $y=(k-1)x+2k$ where $k>1$ which cuts the x-axis and y-axis at points A and B respectively. If the area of $\triangle AOB$ is 9 square units, find all possible values of k.
### Helicopter
PM.MATHLEAGUE.VA.CHAMP: Sorry @below that was my bad. The part that you messed up on is when you wrote $(-\frac{2k}{k-1})(2k)(\frac{1}{2})=9$; you actually have to take the absolute value of $(-\frac{2k}{k-1})$ and write $\left|-\frac{2k}{k-1}\right|\left(2k\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=9$, since $k>1$ and multiplying it by $-4$ will give a negative number, which cannot be a side length.
